# NS Community Crowdfunding Thesis

## The Problem
At Network School (NS), students and members want certain community improvements and capital expenditures (capex) - things like folding tables, easels, drum kits, and other shared resources that enhance the learning and community experience.

## The Solution: Community-Driven Funding + Matching Program

### Phase 1: Proof of Demand
- Students/members propose specific capex items they want
- Community crowdfunds these proposals to demonstrate genuine demand
- Money talks: if people contribute their own funds, it shows real need/desire

### Phase 2: Balaji Matching Program
With proof of community investment, approach Balaji with:
1. **Demonstrated demand**: "Students put their money where their mouth is"
2. **Alignment with NS mission**: Items support learning, creativity, community building
3. **Matching proposal**: "Community raised $X, requesting NS match of $Y"

### Why This Works
- **Skin in the game**: Contributors demonstrate real commitment
- **Community ownership**: People care more about things they helped fund
- **Reasonable ask**: Matching proven community demand vs. speculative requests
- **Scalable**: Can work for ongoing community needs

## Target Items (Capex, Not Opex)
- **Folding tables**: Events, workshops, community gatherings
- **Art easels**: Creative workshops, design thinking
- **Drum kit**: Music sessions, team building
- **Other durable goods** that serve the community long-term

## The Broader Vision: NS Learn-Earn Pipeline

### Current State Analysis
NS needs to solidify its position as a practical, legitimate school that generates income for students.

### Key Metrics (All Interrelated)
1. **More NS Students Earning Money**
2. **More Bounties/Work Opportunities**

## Implementation Roadmap
1. ✅ **Build crowdfunding platform** (this app)
2. **Launch with 3-5 pilot proposals** (tables, easels, drum kit)
3. **Gather community funding** (prove demand)
4. **Approach Balaji** with data and matching request
5. **Scale program** based on success
6. **Integrate with broader learn-earn initiatives**

## Success Metrics
- **Community participation**: % of NS members who contribute
- **Funding velocity**: Time from proposal to funding
- **Matching success**: NS leadership buy-in and matching funds
- **Item utilization**: How often funded items are used
- **Community satisfaction**: Member sentiment about funded improvements

## Next Steps: NS Roadmap Website
Create a transparent roadmap showing:
- **Where we came from**: NS history and achievements  
- **Where we are**: Current state, metrics, challenges
- **Where we're going**: Vision, goals, milestones
- **Current bottlenecks**: What's slowing progress
